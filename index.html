        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>This website is a project in my coding journey. While I'm learning,I'm changing things in the site.
            The intention is to create a portfolio in order that people like you can see my abilities.
            Whichever technology that you work with, I can learn it and be proficient in a few months.
            As you can see in my CV, I'm a passionate about learning, especially languages & things related to
            Computer Science. I hope you enjoy this project and that I hope to be working with you soon.
        </p>
